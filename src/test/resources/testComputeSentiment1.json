We do know quite a bit about its specs, though, thanks to numerous leaks. The upcoming low-cost ‌iPhone‌ will be similar in design to the ‌iPhone 8‌, with thicker top and bottom bezels and a Touch ID Home button. It will be equipped with the same A13 chip that's available in the iPhone 11 and 11 Pro, and it is said to have 3GB RAM. To keep costs low, it will use a single-lens rear camera, though it's not known if the camera will be the same as the wide-angle camera in the ‌iPhone 11‌."
